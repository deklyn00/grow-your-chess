## Testing

  Browsers tested were Chrome, Firefox, OperaGX, and Safari. All browsers performed exactly the same and as expected apart from one instance. Chrome on my iPhone12 would not display the landing page in portrait mode and     would not load the website unless tilted into landscape mode; the issue was found on no other devices and no fix was found.

  All HTML passed through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
  All CSS passed through [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

## Bugs

  Visual bugs can be found on specific devices whose displays may have a less common screen size. These bugs could be fixed in the future with media queries as they are found.

## Deployment

  The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

  1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
  2. In the drop-down menu of the source section, select the Master Branch option.
  3. After the master branch has been selected, if not automatically, refresh the page, and a detailed ribbon will appear on display to indicate the successful deployment.
